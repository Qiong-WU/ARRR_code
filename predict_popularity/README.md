# Introduction
Matlab codes for examining Adaptive-RRR on the Twitter dataset.

## Entry:
X_test_driver.m is the entry file. For each loop, it 
 (1) loads training, validation and testing dataset 
 (2) scans parameters for the selected method and chooses the parameters from the best validation dataset.
 (3) save the in-sample and out-of-sample results with the optimal parameters in (2).
 
Variable "mode" is used to control the model we run.

## Data: 
the input consists of the training(x_train, y_train), validation(x_val, y_val) and testing dataset(x_test, y_test). One can recover d1, d2, and n from these variables. For example, in the training period, [d1,n] = size(x_train) and [d2,n] = size(y_train)

sample_tweet.mat is the sample data where it has x_train, y_train, x_val, y_val, x_test, and y_test. d1 = 500, d2 = 20, and n = 243. The features are generated by the past-5-daysâ€˜ popularity from 100 users with most interactions. We randomly sample 20 users and generate the responses. 



## Reference:

For nuclear norm solver, we used the NNLS package [1].
